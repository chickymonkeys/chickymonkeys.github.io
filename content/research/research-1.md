Does the experience of a banking crisis has an effect on households' portfolios? We investigate this question by focusing on households that migrated to Germany between 1950 and the 2007 financial crisis. Combining data on migrants from 123 different countries with data on systemic banking crises, we identify the impact of the crisis' experience through the variation in the timing of arrival. We compare households' portfolios of those with a household head that experienced a systemic banking crisis in her country of ancestry with those that did not. Focusing on loan portfolios, we find that household that witnessed at least a crisis earlier in their life are less likely to hold consumer loans than those that never experienced a crisis. Moreover, we show that the probability of borrowing is lower for migrants who experienced multiple crises compared to those that experienced a single episode, suggesting a cumulative effect of banking shocks. We propose analogous evidence on real estate portfolios. Overall, our results suggest that the cost financial crises is not limited to the short-term effects driven by losses in wealth and income, but rather a long-lasting effect due to households changing their behaviour.
