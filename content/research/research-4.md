This paper provides the first empirical evidence supporting the "folk hypothesis" that the 1783 volcanic eruption in Iceland contributed to unrest during the French Revolution. Using estimates of sulfur dioxide concentrations and historical protest data, we show that regions more exposed to the eruption experienced significantly more subsistence riots both before and during the Revolution. A one standard deviation increase in haze exposure led to a 9-12 percentage point increase in riot probability in the years immediately following the eruption, an effect that carries through during the revolutionary years. We propose a mechanism linking the eruption to social unrest through its negative impact on agriculture and subsequent increases in grain prices. Our findings contribute to the broader literature on the causes of the French Revolution and the relationship between climatic conditions and social conflict.
