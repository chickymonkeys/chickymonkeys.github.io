This paper shows that credit shocks are an important determinant of the recent rise of populism. Exploiting spatial variation in exposure to an exogenous lending cut by a large German bank in 2007-08, we find that exposure to the credit shock leads to a persistent increase in populist political preferences. To explore the shift in demand for populism activated by the shock, we measure the degree of populist rhetoric and the salience of bank-related topics to each party over time using a machine learning technique on the corpus of parliamentary speeches in Germany. A county-level analysis suggests that the underlying mechanism lies in the perceived decay of the local economy across voters that stems from the credit shock. A machine learning decomposition of the individual causal effects indicates that labour market history is the most important factor shaping the response in populist preferences.
